## ‚ú® Features

*   **Robust RESTful API:** Provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Search:** Endpoints support filtering tasks by `status` and `priority`, as well as a full-text `search` on task titles and descriptions.
*   **Email Notifications:** Automatically sends emails using Nodemailer upon task creation and updates.
*   **Scheduled Reminders:** A daily cron job runs to check for tasks due the next day and sends reminder emails.
*   **Secure & Configurable:** Uses environment variables (`.env`) to securely manage database credentials and application secrets.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the backend server up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or newer recommended)
*   npm (or yarn / pnpm)
*   A running MySQL Server instance
*   Git

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KottaiRaja/Task_Management_Backend.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Task_Management_Backend
    ```

3.  **Set up the Database:**
    *   Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    *   Using a MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or the command line), execute the script located at `db_setup.sql` to create the `taskmaster_db` database and the `tasks` table.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Copy the contents below into your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```dotenv
    # .env file

    # --- Database Connection ---
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_USER=your_mysql_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=taskmaster_db

    # --- Server Configuration ---
    PORT=5000

    # --- Email Credentials (Gmail with an App Password is recommended) ---
    # The email account that will send notifications.
    EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
    # The 16-character App Password generated from your Google Account.
    EMAIL_PASS=your16characterapppassword
    ```

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Start the Server:**
    *   For development with auto-restarting on file changes:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   For production:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    The API server will now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
